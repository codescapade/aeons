Main todos:
  ✔ Better audio implementation. At the moment it just has a play function. @done(22-04-20 05:58)
  ☐ Refactor camera implementation. Maybe not use a render target for each camera.
  ☐ Look into possibility of adding systems after entities have been added.
  ✔ Make optional fields in events optional in the get function. @done(22-04-05 21:18)
  ☐ Update gamepads to not be hardcoded at 4 max.
  ✔ Refactor simple physics hit implementation to use an object pool. @done(22-04-03 14:57)
  ☐ Update simple physics collision resolution to use previous position to see where it came from so it doesn't get stuck as much.
  ✔ Implement debug drawing in systems and components. @done(22-04-03 14:57)
  ✔ Add implementation for storage service. @done(22-04-20 16:50)

Bugs:
  ☐ Fix debug drawing for systems when something is parented to the camera.
  ☐ Fix screen to world and back for rotated cameras.
