## Khafile the Kha configuration file
The khafile is the configuration file for the project. You can use it to add libraries, set where the assets are
located, set the source path etc.  

I will add an explanation for the settings here in the future as not all setting are useful for Aeons, but for now Kha
has a wiki page explaining the configuration settings [here](https://github.com/Kode/Kha/wiki/khafile.js){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
