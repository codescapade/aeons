## Getting started
With Aeons you can develop on Windows, MacOS, or Linux and export to multiple platforms on desktop, web, mobile and
consoles through the [Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} framework.  

To install Aeons have a look at the [Installation]({{ '/docs/getting_started/installation' | url }}) section.  

If you already have Aeons installed you can see how to create and use an Aeons project in [Creating a new project]({{ '/docs/getting_started/new_project' |url }})
or you can check out some of the [examples](https://codescapade.github.io/aeons-examples).  

Developing using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is the
preferred way, because there are extensions to help you with debugging and autocompletion. See [VSCode Extensions]({{ '/docs/getting_started/vscode_extensions' | url }}) to see the extensions to install.
