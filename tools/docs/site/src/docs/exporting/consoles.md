## exporting to Consoles
The [Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha) framework that Aeons is built on top of supports exporting to consoles, but the code for that is not public.  
If you are a registered developer with Microsoft/Nintendo/Sony you can ask on the [Kha repo](https://github.com/Kode/Kha/discussions) how to export.
