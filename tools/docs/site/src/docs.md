## Welcome to Aeons

Aeons is a 2d game engine powered by [Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha) and written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org).  
Aeons doesn't have a build-in editor like some other engines. This is an engine if you like to write code. There is support 
for external editors like [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/).

### ECS
Aeons aims to be flexible. It uses an ECS pattern for most built-in systems, but you don't have to use it if you don't want to.
You can use some of it or none at all. You can build your game however you like.
